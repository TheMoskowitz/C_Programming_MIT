# C_Programming_MIT
All coursework I did for the MIT class "Practical Programming in C"

I've been using C++ for some time but never done a course in pure C before so it was good for that purpose.

It was a decent set of assignments. The lectures aren't online (at least not that I could find) so I read through all the lecture notes instead.
